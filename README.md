# 📝 Sign-up Form

A simple **Sign-up Form** project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) curriculum — *Intermediate HTML and CSS* module.

This exercise focuses on creating a **registration form** using clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS practices.  
It emphasizes correct structure, field validation, and visual organization — without responsive design yet (that topic is covered later in the course).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice building a **sign-up form** from scratch.
- Apply semantic HTML form elements such as:
  - `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`
- Use proper field attributes for validation:
  - `required`, `type`, `pattern`, `minlength`, etc.
- Style the layout using **Flexbox**.
- Understand how form validation works natively in HTML without JavaScript.

---

## 💡 Features

- Native **HTML5 validation** (using `pattern` and `type` attributes).  
- Custom `pattern` regex for password validation (e.g. requiring letters and numbers).  
- Clean and readable layout using Flexbox.  
- Form fields grouped and aligned with consistent spacing.  
- Focus and hover styles for better user experience.  
- Static, non-responsive design (responsive techniques come later in TOP).

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Structuring a form with accessible and semantic markup.  
- Grouping related inputs using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.  
- Using the `pattern` attribute for simple regex validation.  
- Understanding lookahead patterns like `(?=.*\d)` in regex.  
- Styling forms using Flexbox instead of tables or margin-based positioning.  
- Applying pseudo-classes like `:focus`, `:valid`, and `:invalid`.
